# TheQuestForAQuest
2D arcade scroller written in python. Using mostly pygame at this point.


To run the game right now add files to a project folder in pycharm or other editor. 
As of right now, the first commit you will need to run questtest.py and the game will start.


Thank you for taking the time to readme.
